I am Kanan Ahmadov, a dual-degree BS & MS Computer Engineering student at Washington University in St. Louis, with an anticipated Bachelor's graduation in May 2025 and a Master's graduation in May 2026. Currently, I'm completing the second half of the 3+3 dual-degree engineering program. In the first half of this program, I attended Augustana University and earned double BA degrees in Mathematics and Physics, graduating with Magna Cum Laude Honors.

As a computer engineering student, I’m passionate about both software and hardware, and I’m always eager to learn and apply new technologies to solve challenging problems.

Feel free to reach out at a.kanan@wustl.edu if you'd like to connect!
