# Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am Kanan Ahmadov, a dual-degree BS & MS Computer Engineering student at Washington University in St. Louis, with an anticipated Bachelor's graduation in May 2025 and a Master's graduation in May 2026. Currently, I'm completing the second half of the 3+3 dual-degree engineering program. In the first half of this program, I attended Augustana University and earned double BA degrees in Mathematics and Physics, graduating with Magna Cum Laude Honors.

As a computer engineering student, Iâ€™m passionate about both software and hardware, and Iâ€™m always eager to learn and apply new technologies to solve challenging problems.

Feel free to reach out at a.kanan@wustl.edu if you'd like to connect!
